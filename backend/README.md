# Quiz Generator API  üìöü§ñ

## Overview üöÄ
The **Quiz Generator API** is a Django REST Framework-based application that allows users to generate quizzes using OpenAI's GPT model. Users can create quizzes based on prompts, retrieve questions, save answers, compute quiz results, and view popular quiz topics.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Generate a Quiz:** Users can generate quizzes based on a provided prompt.
- **Retrieve Questions:** Users can fetch specific quiz questions and their possible answers.
- **Save User Answers:** Answers given by users are stored in the database.
- **Compute Quiz Results:** The system evaluates user responses and returns quiz results.
- **Popular Quiz Topics:** Retrieves the most popular quiz topics.
- **AI Integration:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to generate quizzes dynamically.
- **Celery Tasks:** Implements background tasks for analytics and cleanup.

### Input Validation & Restrictions üö®
Before generating a quiz, the API enforces the following restrictions:

### ‚úÖ **Valid Quiz Topic Required**
- If the prompt is unrelated (e.g., `"Hello, World"`), the API returns:
  ```json
  {"message": "I am a Quiz Generator. Please provide a valid topic to generate a quiz for you!"}
  ```
### ‚úÖ **Max 10 Questions**
- If the user requests more than **10 questions**, the API returns:
  ```json
  {"message": "The maximum number of questions I can generate is 10."}
  ```
### ‚úÖ **Max 4 Possible Answers Per Question**
- If the user requests more than **4 possible answers**, the API returns:
  ```json
  {"message": "Maximum size of possible answers is 4."}
  ```

## Quiz Response Format üìã

### **Without Possible Answers** (Default Format)
If the user does not request multiple-choice options:
```json
{
  "Who discovered gravity?": [],
  "has_possible_answers": false,
  "topic_name": "Science"
}
```

### **With Possible Answers**
If the user requests multiple-choice options:
```json
{
  "What is 2+2?": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
  "has_possible_answers": true,
  "topic_name": "Math"
}
```

## API Endpoints üì°

### 1. Generate a Quiz
**Endpoint:** `POST /generate_quiz/`
- Requires authentication.
- Accepts a `prompt` string.
- Returns the first generated question ID.

### 2. Retrieve a Question
**Endpoint:** `GET /questions/<pk>/`
- Requires authentication.
- Retrieves a specific question and its possible answers.

### 3. Save User Answer
**Endpoint:** `POST /save_answer/`
- Requires authentication.
- Saves the user's selected answer.

### 4. Compute Quiz Result
**Endpoint:** `POST /compute_quiz/`
- Requires authentication.
- Evaluates quiz performance and returns the score.

### 5. Popular Quiz Topics
**Endpoint:** `GET /popular_quiz_topics/`
- Returns the top 5 most popular quiz topics.

---

## Background Tasks
- **count_topics:** Tracks the popularity of quiz topics.
- **delete_generated_quiz:** Deletes a user's generated quiz data after computation.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Redis
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gioms101/AI-QUIZ.git
   cd quiz
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file and add the following:
   ```env
   OPEN_AI_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   ```

5. **Run Migrations:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start Redis and Celery Workers:**
   ```sh
   redis-server &  # Start Redis

   ```

7. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

So what should you do is that to create design for that back end application, 
using Javascript, Html, CSS ... (I need Front-End APP)

So I will tell you how pages should look alike: On the first page where prompt will be displayed (to generate quiz)
the first thing you should do is to if user is not authenticated you should redirect them to log in page to actually authorize.
next thing you should do is to send GET request to 'have_already_generated_quiz/' api endpoint
to figure out if user has already generated quiz and hasn't finished his quiz.
If user has unfinished quiz you should display something like pop up window to inform
user if he wants to continue that unfinished quiz or not.
So if user wants to continue his generated quiz you should send GET request
to 'get_question_id' which returns the question id of where user had to answer it but due to some reason he exit from that quiz
In case user want to generate a new quiz, you should send POST request to
'delete_user_quiz' api endpoint to delete user's generated questions and answers
and after that user can
prompt quiz topic to generate quiz with its questions and possible answers.
so When user enters prompt in case it's successfull and passes all the validation
on that page should be created something alike button which redirect user to actual quiz question (That's means that quiz has started)
When user will be redirected to first question (Which I return id of the first question)
the url of that page should not be dynamic (Back End side will be dynamic like questions/pk)
But I don't want to be dynamic url on the front end side. So URL
should look like something like that: e.g (quiz/) 
So it should be front-end responsibility to get next question id by adding +1 to the current question id.
So If '/questions/<pk>/' endpoint returns 'End of quiz' message that means that quiz has ended to that user
and you should send POST request to compute_quiz/ api endpoint. which will
evaluate the result of user. Also for statistic's sake I have endpoint
which computes Top 5 most frequently generated topics and you can display it
on prompt page (where user generates quizzes)
